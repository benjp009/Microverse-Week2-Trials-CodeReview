# YouTube Code copy for Microverse project

Thanks to @Eckybrazz to share with me his code :) 

## I will be acting as a reviewer to review the code

To be able to review the code, I will need to know the best practice for a <b>Code Review</b> 

### What to check?
<ul> 
<li> Does the reviewed project run on your machine?</li> 
<li> Does the reviewed project work properly?</li>
<li> Are there any linters errors?</li>
<li> Is the correct flow used?</li>
<li> Is the repository documented in a professional way?</li>
<li> Are there any bugs that were missed by the author?</li>
<li> Is there any room for improvement in the project?</li>
